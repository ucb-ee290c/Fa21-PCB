# Test PCB for EE290C Spring 2021 Tapeout Class Chip

This is the repo for the PCB. Designed in Altium designer. DRC specs set by Bay Area Circuits standard process.

Uses symbols and footprints from the BWRC libraries.

**Rev 1:** Initial PCB

**Rev 2:** Electrically the same as rev 1; several silkscreen labelling improvements and corrections to headers. Changed the SMA connector footprints to be all through-hole instead of SMD center. Production change had the vias in the FMC connector actually filled this time.

### Useful Things

*Schematic Editor*

Tools (T) -> Footprint manager: assign footprints

T->A->A: Annotate schematics

*PCB Editor*

T->M: Clear all error markers

T->G->A: Rebuild all pours
